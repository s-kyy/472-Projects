## About
Solves a board game (see [this](https://tinyurl.com/y6bfgsvd)) through three basic artificial intelligence algorithms: Depth Frist Search (DFS), Best First Search (BFS) and A-star. The runtime for each algorithm is outputted in the terminal. The resulting output file contains the puzzle solutions for each algorithm as well as the nodes the algorithm has searched. 

## How to Run the Program
1. Navigate on terminal to directory of main.py
2. Make sure dependencies are installed (pip install numpy)
3. run "python main.py"
